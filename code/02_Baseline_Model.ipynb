In the case of a balanced dataset (50-50 split between two classes), if you set a constant prediction using DummyClassifier(strategy='constant', constant=0), you would expect an accuracy of 0.5 if the constant you're predicting matches the majority class.\n","\n","However, achieving an accuracy of exactly 0.5 might not happen due to randomness in the train-test split and the way the classifier handles ties or borderline cases. The DummyClassifier in scikit-learn randomly shuffles the data before splitting, and it might end up predicting the constant label in a manner that results in a slightly lower accuracy than the expected 0.5.\n","\n","Additionally, if the dataset size is small, this randomness can have a more significant impact on the accuracy. For example, if you have only a few samples, the actual percentage of correctly predicted samples might slightly differ from the expected 50% due to the nature of random sampling.\n","\n","To confirm this behavior and better understand why you're observing an accuracy of 0.467 instead of the expected 0.5, you might want to perform multiple runs of the experiment, changing the random seed or using cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the accuracy. This can help you see the variance in the accuracy scores and confirm that the classifier is indeed predicting the constant label '0' as expected, albeit with a slightly lower accuracy due to random fluctuations in the dataset splits."],"metadata":{"id":"ORcH3yG_BTpm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"n6GAxpoiBXvE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701632807032,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Cynthia Taylor Xu","userId":"02918660707215341188"}}},"execution_count":50,"outputs":[]}]}
